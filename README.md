This program finds the notes of an arpeggio that the user types in. It will eventually be able to show where the notes of the arpeggio are on the fretboard of a guitar to help with soloing with chord tones. At some point I'd like to also be able to add different chords that can align with the bpm and time signature of a song so that the display can update along with that song.
